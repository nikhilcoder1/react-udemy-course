# React Udemy Course 🚀

This repository documents my complete learning journey while following a **React.js course on Udemy**.  
It contains multiple **mini-projects, practice apps, and experiments** built to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals and commonly used patterns.

The goal of this repo is **hands-on learning**, not just theory.

## 📌 What This Repository Is About

- Learning React by **building real projects**
- Understanding React concepts through **practical implementation**
- Exploring modern React tooling like **Vite, Tailwind CSS, Context API, and React Router**
- Maintaining a single place to track my **React progress**
